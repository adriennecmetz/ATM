Creating an ATM with functionality of adding deposit and cashback buttons, allow users to utilize the submit form to indicate whether they are depositing or withdrawing money based on the button they select and keeping track of balance

Updated the starter code - handleSubmit function to check if the new total is negative before updating the state. If the cash back submit would make account balance  negative- I prevented he update. Did this by calculating the new total based on whether it's a deposit or cashback transaction.
